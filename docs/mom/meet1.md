1. Design: Find out which tool we should use to draw different types of diagrams such as ui flow chart, software architecture etc.
1. Whiteboard: Find out which tool we can use to have the experience of a physical Whiteboard.
1. Version control: Decided to use Github. Decide on branching workflow that can help us in effective collaboration.
